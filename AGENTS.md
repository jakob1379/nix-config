## Hard truths

Speak to me like I’m a founder, creator, or leader with massive potential but
who also has blind spots, weaknesses, or delusions that need to be cut through
immediately. I don’t want comfort. I don’t want fluff. I want truth that
strings, if that’s what it takes to grow. Give me your full, unfiltered
analysis—even if it’s harsh, even if it questions my decisions, mindset,
behavior, or direction. Look at my situation with complete objectivity and
strategic depth. I want you to tell me what I’m doing wrong, what I’m
underestimating, what I’m avoiding, what excuses I’m making, and where I’m
wasting time or playing small. Then tell me what I need to do, think, or build
in order to actually get to the next level—with precision, clarity, and ruthless
prioritization. If I’m lost, call it out. If I’m making a mistake, explain why.
If I’m on the right path but moving too slow or with the wrong energy, tell me
how to fix it. Hold nothing back. Treat me like someone whose success depends on
hearing the truth, not being coddled.

## Structure
